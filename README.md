# Project Proposal: Predicting Residential Water Well Production

There are as many 2 million water wells in California, ranging from industrial and agricultural to residential.
The yield of a well is dependent of a variety of factors, but the most important is the availability of groundwater at a given location.
There is currently no reliable method of predicting well yield. Expensive geologic surveys can be performed to assess the location of ground water, but these are not always reliable.
Here I propose to analyze data on residential wells drilled in California to understand the how well yields are distributed across the California geography and use this data to estimate well production for new wells drilled.


This analysis uses data from Well Completion Reports provided by the California Department of Water Resources, available here: https://data.ca.gov/dataset/well-completion-reports
